# Battleship

[Battleship](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)>) Game in JavaScript.

ðŸ‘‰ Play the game [here](http://rrohit.me/battleship/).

This project is inspired by the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship).

## I learned

This is my first project of considerable size and complexity. I know that there
is a lot of room for improvement, but I am very happy with the results.
Here are some of the things I learned in no particular order:

- Writing modular code
- Testing with Jest: This was my first time using a testing framework.
- Using Webpack
- Using ES6 modules
- Writing a game loop in JavaScript (this was not easy haha because of the
  asynchronous nature of JavaScript)
- Creating a simple AI
- Using the Factory Pattern
